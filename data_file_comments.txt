# data.yaml file:
#  Data file for perigee health plots
#  Structure includes info and telem sections
#
#  INFO
#  info section:
#    sample_interval_in_secs: we break the telemetry up into n sec
# intervals and examine each section across all of the interesting
# telemetry columns.  This was designed to help us deal with telemetry
# with different intervals.  Not as much of an issue for aca0 telem
#    min_required_samples: number of necessary data points (telemetry
# slices) within the sample interval to bother working with the data.
# Data is discarded if incomplete below this threshold within the
# interval.  For aca, min required 5 in a 20 second interval is *all*
# the telemetry.
#    number_of_intervals: tstop - tstart / sample_interval_in_secs
#    tstart: tstart of the perigee pass as defined by radmon 
#    tstop: tstop of the perigee pass as defined by radmon
#
#  TELEM
#  telem: contains a hash of the columns data from aca0
#  image files.  Columns aca_temp, ccd_temp, time, obsid, dac are keys of
#  the hash.  Values are stored as plain array elements (not PDLs).
#  The slices of telemetry are aligned, so aca_temp[5] will be from
#  time time[5].
